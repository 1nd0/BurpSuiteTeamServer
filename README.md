An open source chat server implemented in pure Go.  The chat server listens on a TCP port. It supports the following concepts:

 1. Chat clients: A chat client represents the person who is sending and receiving messages
 2. Chat rooms: A chat room is a place where multiple chat clients can be added. All clients connected to the same chat room will see their messages
